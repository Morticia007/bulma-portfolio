                    <h1>Usability Testing </h1>
                    <div style={{ maxWidth: 840 }}>
                      <h5>14 participants</h5>
                      <p>I used maze to test with users</p>
                      <p>
                        All participants were given 2 scenarios and 2 tasks to
                        complete. The tasks test for:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Opening the messages</li>
                          <li>New chat reply feature</li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>At first it seemed testers were doing okay </li>
                        <li>
                          Then the results started taking a terrible nose dive
                        </li>
                        <li>Users were going way off the assumed path </li>
                        <li>
                          I got feedback that the test was broken and the
                          testers were getting trapped becuase the test screen
                          was not scaling correctly
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        So I stopped the test right away to look at the results.
                        To my suprise the path most testers were taking (when
                        the test was working) was not the path I had built out.
                        These participants didn't even make it to the second
                        task because they either didn't know the path I had
                        built out or they were frustrated and bounced. This
                        insight was so vital! Once the test had broken no one
                        was getting to the second task at all due to the scaling
                        issue. so I figured out a small hidden trick in maze to
                        make sure it scaled correctly and ran it again.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Second Test</h3>
                      <h5>5 Participants</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Users were still going off the path</li>
                        <li>60% made it to the second task</li>
                        <li>
                          It was confirmed, I was going to have to build out the
                          other path users preferred to get an accurate result
                          for the new chat feature
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        I did, however, despite the test mishaps recieve very
                        positive feedback on the need for the feature, and the
                        overall idea.
                      </p>

                          Build out the screen that message bubble in the navbar
                          connects to.

                            existing platform and not account for all paths
                            users take to get there!
                          </h6>

                          Users want what they want! This is not negative at
                          all! It teaches us valuable lessons about mental
                          models. If I were to test this with 100 people, my
                          assumption is that only 30 would make it to the new
                          feature to test it. Reason: I didn't account for the
                          more likely path that the other 70 people would
                          choose. I am curious now though, if I ran it again
                          with only the new path hooked up would the results of
                          that test be 70 made it and 30 never making it?
                          Unfortunately with the constraint of two weeks I set
                          for myself, at this time I will just move into the
                          revision phase and test both paths. I will definitely
                          revisit this and test the second path alone to see if
                          my assumptions are correct or if I will uncover more
                          gold!

                          I think I learned more than I ever have about users,
                          user/task flows, mental models, and design systems
                          than I could of ever expected. Users are used to these
                          platforms already and use them daily, so when they
                          aren't given what they are used to test results can
                          get skewed very quickly.

                          This was a bit more difficult to accomplish in this
                          project, and it showed me that no matter what, I
                          should always test no matter how difficult it is. Even
                          if it's by asking participants to just open the
                          existing platform and show me how they navigate it. If
                          I would have implimented this step I would have made
                          the realization much earlier, that there was an
                          important step I was missing in this project.
