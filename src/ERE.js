              <h2>WEEK 1 | RESEARCH</h2>
              <p>
                To understand this undertaking and how I could help this small
                business, I needed to understand their customers first. I
                prioritized my focus on first finding out:
                <ul>
                  <li>Who they are</li>
                  <li>Why they need this product</li>
                  <li>If I could align user needs with the business needs </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                It was quite the challenge to get these guys to talk. I say
                guys, because the hobbyist I was able to find were 100% men.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information I did find was pretty specific. They struggle
                with finding:
                <ol>
                  <li>Quality products</li>
                  <li>Sources they can trust for those products</li>
                  <li>
                    Quality sites that don't have "unsecure" in the browser
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Time to put in all the work thay would need to find the
                    quality they are searching for
                  </li>

                As a busy mechanic who just wants to build fun projects in my
                spare time, I want to have access to quality parts and quality
                websites that are secure. People who build motorized bicycles,
                do it in their spare time while working 40 hours a week. So it
                would be nice to find a company that I can trust, and that
                delivers the products I need, especially if the products and/or
                the site save me time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see Justin needs
                <ol>

                  <li>consistancy</li>
                  <li>security</li>
                  <li>a way to save time</li>
                </ol>
                His frustrations are
                <ol>
                  <li>low quality sites </li>
                  <li>lack of contact options for questions</li>
                  <li>build difficulties</li>

                    To understand the competitive landscape and how users

                      <li>Weight loss apps are stressful</li>

                      Let's reference our proto persona first before we get to
                      the possible solution - Darko used Reddit and Discord.
                      Both of those are somewhat of a community.

                      and struggle with loneliness, eating disorders, lack of
                      community and/support.

                    what forums they want to be active in by creating the
                    ability to pass on forums that they had no interest in.

                      Originally I had planned for this to be main navigation.
                      So I placed everything I could think of that could posibly
                      go into this screen, in order to come back and delegate
                      and clean up during iteration .

                    <h3>Mockup</h3>
                    <p>
                      Cleaned this up significantly when I chose to use the
                      segment picker navigation route.

                    <p>
                      Originally I designed this screen for users personal posts
                      to live in, as I was using established forums like reddit,
                      and instagram for inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mockup 1</h3>
                    <p>
                      During iteration I decided to clean it up and give the
                      user another level of control, to be able to chose if they
                      want to see those things by adjusting it to a menu. this
                      was also to cut down on clutter and not confuse the user.

                      This screen was a free for all at fist, I hadn't
                      established what content would be most appropriate for the
                      functionality.

                      As all of the screens evolved, the activity screen seemed
                      to just take form itself. Being that it is for discussion,
                      I looked back into my research participants and what
                      seemed important for them, also looking at what other
                      applications they would be using, the data that could be
                      possible and added them respectfully.

                        Seemed to get stuck on the viewing now dropdown when

                      <p>
                        When tasked to create a post, were reluctant to choose
                        the floating button. Once given help they reported they
                        thought it was what they were supposed to do, but were
                        thrown off by the plus icon on the floating button.

                        Thats Great! Except when that's not the place you were
                        hoping they would chose when tasked with something other
                        than finding the viewing now dropdown.

                        Reported to really enjoy the experience despite the few

                      <p>
                        I was pleased by the feedback I got overall. The
                        participants liked the look and simplicity of the web
                        app. They validated many functions and gave me great
                        feedback on the objectives that didn't make it to
                        validation.

                          Feedback and iteration is the most important part of
                          design when you are user centric. Without the
                          feedback, my project may have not tested as well as it
                          did.

                          Knowing when, why, and how is the hard part. Luckily I
                          am a pattern person and was able to see that there was
                          much more of a need for community than another weight
