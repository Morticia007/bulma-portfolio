              <h2>WEEK 1 | RESEARCH</h2>
              <p>
                To understand this undertaking and how I could help this small
                business, I needed to understand their customers first. I
                prioritized my focus on first finding out:
                <ul>
                  <li>Who they are</li>
                  <li>Why they need this product</li>
                  <li>If I could align user needs with the business needs </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                It was quite the challenge to get these guys to talk. I say
                guys, because the hobbyist I was able to find were 100% men.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information I did find was pretty specific. They struggle
                with finding:
                <ol>
                  <li>Quality products</li>
                  <li>Sources they can trust for those products</li>
                  <li>
                    Quality sites that don't have "unsecure" in the browser
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Time to put in all the work thay would need to find the
                    quality they are searching for
                  </li>
                </ol>

              <p>
                As a busy mechanic who just wants to build fun projects in my
                spare time, I want to have access to quality parts and quality
                websites that are secure. People who build motorized bicycles,
                do it in their spare time while working 40 hours a week. So it
                would be nice to find a company that I can trust, and that
                delivers the products I need, especially if the products and/or
                the site save me time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see Justin needs
                <ol>
                  <li>quality</li>
                  <li>consistancy</li>
                  <li>security</li>
                  <li>a way to save time</li>
                </ol>
                His frustrations are
                <ol>
                  <li>low quality sites </li>
                  <li>lack of contact options for questions</li>

                  <p>
                    At first the challenge was finding a competitor! ERE wasn't
                    awar of anyone else making these products.Luckily I asked
                    some pretty good questions in my initial research and found
                    out there was 1 individual other than ERE that does make an
                    engine stand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the lack of competition, it got me sratching my
                    head. Is this company in a failing market or are they ahead
                    of the curve? So I returned back to my interviews and
                    scoured for some information around the need for this
                    product. I uncovered all the needs my participants had
                    divulged including
                    <ul>
                      <li>wrestling with a motor while building</li>
                      <li>
                        having to mount and remove the motor to make adjustments
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the bike falling over during these mounts and dismounts
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        extra motors lying aroud that could definitly use a

                    </ul>
                    <p> </p>I felt a bit better about the health of ERE at that
                    point! I thought, okay wow "he is a UX designer for

                      So at this point it only seemed right to start the design

                    <p>
                      I decided based on everything I had learned up to now, to
                      build an e-commerce web app that made the contact process
                      easy, along with the purchase process. I wanted to go a
                      step further though and include some of the gold I had
                      gathered along the way! While writing the mission
                      statement and the story about the company it was clear
                      that the owner of ERE is bound and detemined to make the
                      hobbyist life easier and more connected, and the hobbyist
                      was screaming for help with getting the inside scoop! I'll
                      take you on the golden journey next.

                    I knew going into this design, being an e-commerce site,
                    there would be a ton of screens even though I was only
                    designing an MVP. My main focus for ERE specifically is
                    contact and purchase.

                        The answers were unanimously "no", and then followed up
                        with why they wouldn't change anything, without being
                        promted or asked. This validation was a big relief, (and

                          consistant feedback. I am not a fan of wasting anyones
                          time. I am very aware that at any point in a project
                          without consistently getting feedback, the project
                          could go down the wrong path very easily.

                          much impact on the project, besides understanding fail
                          vs. innovation). It did, however, give me an insight
                          into the passion and innovation of the owner of ERE.
