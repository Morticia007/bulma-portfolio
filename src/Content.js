          I used my experience and challenges with helping people with weight
          loss as a starting point for my research. My initial hypothesis
          evolved as I began to understand my users and their varying needs. My
          initial hypothesis was based on my experience with, a variety of
          people I had helped over the years and my want to understand why so
          many people struggle.

          I committed to completing this, with an open mind, to find out how I
          could help this niche of folks and build something useful. This was a
          steep learning curve for me, as it was my first official project as a
          Ux/Ui Designer.
